## My process

### Built with

-  HTML5
-  CSS3
-  JavaScript
-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)

### What I learned

-  This was the first major project I ever did. Before undertaking it, I hadn't really put my **JavaScript** skills to the test, and when I say _skills_ I mean that I was only getting started with basic **JavaScript**.
-  At that point in time, I only knew a bit on:

   -  data types
   -  variables
   -  conditional operations
   -  functions
   -  manipulating the DOM

-  I learned how to implement **functional programming** in a project and this allowed me to practice the **Do not Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle**.

### Continued development

-  Going forward, I want to **practice** what I already know by tackling more **JavaScript** focused projects. Ranging from **small** to **large** projects.

-  I also want to learn better coding practices and improve my overall skills in **Frontend Web Development**.

### Useful resources

-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape SVG Editor. I use it all the time when I'm working on any web project. After designing this project, I used _Inkscape's_ in-built tools to figure out the _spacing_, _sizing_ and _positioning_ of elements throughout the project.

## Acknowledgments

I can't thank enough the people who helped me, in one way or another, while I was working on the project. **Thank you**:

-  [Nelson Ombuya](https://www.github.com/nelsonombuya) has been a very long-time friend of mine. He helped me understand how to approach the project by building a better **code architecture** and writing better **logic**.
